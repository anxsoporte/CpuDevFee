# CpuDevFee
Some miners charge a slightly high Fee and we know that those of us who handle a small Hash the profitability lowers us a lot and the investments of the miners are very high and the recovery time grows.
To compensate for this a bit, we have made this patch to set the commission to 0.5% in the Cpuminer miner for Raptoreum.

Cpuminer currently charges 1.75% and adjusts it to 0.5%.

For Windows:
Just copy the cpudevfee.exe file into the folder where the binaries are and run it.

For linux
Download the file and unzip it.
